Monitor installed plugins for security notices, outdated releases, and WPScan disclosures without leaking your site's plugin inventory.

== Description ==

Site Add-on Watchdog keeps an eye on your site's plugins and warns you when:

* Your installed version is two or more minor releases behind the directory build.
* The official changelog mentions security or vulnerability fixes.
* (Optional) WPScan lists open CVEs for the plugin when you provide your own API key.

The plugin runs on a schedule you control—choose daily, weekly, a twenty-minute testing cadence, or rely on manual scans—and stores results locally. Nothing leaves your site unless you explicitly configure outgoing notifications.

=== Privacy first ===

* No plugin inventory or telemetry is ever sent off-site by default.
* Optional webhooks are opt-in and only post the detected risks.
* WPScan lookups only run when you add your personal API token.

=== Admin tools ===

* Dashboard page with the current risk list and manual scan button.
* Ignore list to suppress noisy plugins.
* Notification settings for email, Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or a generic webhook.

=== Notifications ===

* Email: send to one or more recipients (comma separated).
* Discord: post to a channel via webhook.
* Slack: connect via an incoming webhook to post alerts into any workspace channel.
* Microsoft Teams: send adaptive card style notices through an incoming webhook connector.
* Generic webhook: post JSON payload to any endpoint you control, with optional HMAC signatures. Failed deliveries are logged and highlighted on the Watchdog admin screen so you can reconfigure or resend manually.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the admin dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Open the top-level **Watchdog** menu in the WordPress sidebar to review the risk table and adjust notifications (older versions or custom admin menu placements may still show under Tools → Watchdog).
4. (Optional) Add your WPScan API key in the settings to fetch vulnerability intelligence.

== FAQ ==

= Does this plugin share my list of installed plugins? =

No. All scanning happens locally. Data only leaves your site if you enable a webhook or Discord notification yourself.

= How do I get a WPScan API key? =

Register for a free account at [wpscan.com](https://wpscan.com/) and copy the API token from your profile. Paste the token into the Watchdog settings page to enable vulnerability lookups.

= How do I configure Slack or Microsoft Teams notifications? =

Slack requires an Incoming Webhook URL that you can generate from your workspace's App Directory. Microsoft Teams uses an Incoming Webhook connector that supplies its own URL. Paste either URL into the Watchdog notification settings, choose which events to send, and Watchdog will post alerts directly into the selected channel.

= Can I trigger scans manually? =

Yes. Use the "Run manual scan" button on the Watchdog admin page.

= How do I resend a failed notification payload? =

Open the Watchdog admin page and check the **Delivery health** section. If a notification fails, the payload is captured there with buttons to re-queue or download it.

= Where can I find the test suite? =

Tests and the `phpunit.xml.dist` configuration are available in the public repository but are excluded from the published plugin package. Clone the repo from GitHub to run the test suite locally with PHPUnit.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Scheduled scans are not running ===

Watchdog relies on WP-Cron to trigger scheduled scans and notifications. If you have set `DISABLE_WP_CRON` to `true` or your site receives very little traffic (so WP-Cron rarely runs), configure a system cron job to call either `wp-cron.php` or the plugin's REST endpoint. The admin **Delivery health** panel lists the REST URL you can target; a typical example looks like this:

`curl -X POST https://example.com/wp-json/site-add-on-watchdog/v1/cron`

Testing-mode notifications also rely on this trigger, so be sure your cron job is running when validating delivery.

== CLI Usage ==

Watchdog bundles a WP-CLI command so you can run scans outside of the WordPress admin. All examples below assume the command is executed from a shell where `wp` (WP-CLI) is available.

`wp watchdog scan [--notify=<bool>]`

* `--notify` (optional): Accepts `true` or `false` (defaults to `true`). When set to `false`, Watchdog will skip any configured email or webhook notifications and only record the scan locally.

Examples:

* Run a scan and send notifications (default): `wp watchdog scan`
* Run a scan silently (skip notifications): `wp watchdog scan --notify=false`

Recommended workflow: on CI/CD platforms, add a job step that boots your WordPress/WP-CLI container, runs pending database migrations if needed, and then calls `wp watchdog scan --notify=false` to verify the plugin state without spamming production channels. Promote to production by rerunning the same command with notifications enabled when you are ready to alert your team.

== Development ==

The development repository is available on GitHub: https://github.com/happyloa/Site-Add-on-Watchdog. Clone it locally to review the source or run the test suite.
