Monitor installed plugins for security notices, outdated releases, and optional version-aware WPScan disclosures.

== Description ==

Site Add-on Watchdog keeps an eye on your site's plugins and warns you when:

* A newer release is available for an installed plugin, with an additional warning when it is two or more minor releases behind.
* The latest release's official changelog mentions security or vulnerability fixes.
* (Optional) WPScan reports vulnerabilities affecting the installed version when you provide your own API key. This also covers plugins that are not listed on WordPress.org.

The plugin runs on a schedule you control—choose daily, weekly, a twenty-minute testing cadence, or rely on manual scans—and stores results locally. To compare public versions and changelogs, Watchdog looks up plugin slugs individually on WordPress.org and caches each answer for six hours, including the answer that a plugin is not in the directory. A lookup that fails is retried on the next scan. WPScan lookups are optional. Email risk alerts to site administrators are enabled by default; webhook channels require setup and activation.

=== Privacy first ===

* Risk processing and storage stay on your site; Watchdog does not send telemetry, site content, or user data.
* WordPress.org receives a request for each installed plugin slug when its cached directory data expires so Watchdog can retrieve public version and changelog data.
* WPScan receives one plugin-slug lookup at a time only when you add your personal API token.
* Email risk alerts to site administrators are enabled by default and can be disabled in settings. Webhook channels send detected plugin risks only after you configure and enable them.

=== External services ===

Watchdog uses the following external services under the stated conditions:

* **WordPress.org Plugin API (required for directory comparisons):** When cached data is unavailable, Watchdog sends each installed plugin slug separately to retrieve its public version and changelog. No site content or user data is included. See the [WordPress.org service](https://api.wordpress.org/) and [privacy policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/).
* **WPScan API (optional):** When you save a WPScan API token, Watchdog sends that token as authorization and submits one plugin slug at a time to retrieve vulnerability records. See [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/), its [terms](https://wpscan.com/terms/), and the applicable [Automattic privacy policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/).
* **Notification destinations:** Email alerts to site administrators are enabled by default and can be disabled. Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and custom webhooks are optional and send only when configured and enabled. Alerts can include plugin names, installed and available versions, risk or vulnerability details, and links back to your WordPress administration area. Those transmissions are governed by your mail provider or destination service; review the applicable policies for [Discord](https://discord.com/terms) ([privacy](https://discord.com/privacy)), [Slack](https://slack.com/terms-of-service) ([privacy](https://slack.com/trust/privacy/privacy-policy)), or [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) ([privacy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement)).

=== Admin tools ===

* Tabbed dashboard with a searchable risk table, downloadable scan history, delivery status, and manual actions.
* Ignore list to suppress noisy plugins.
* Validated notification settings with a save-and-test action for every channel.

=== Notifications ===

* Email: send to one or more recipients separated by commas, semicolons, or spaces; site administrators are always included.
* Discord: post to a channel via webhook.
* Slack: connect via an incoming webhook to post alerts into any workspace channel.
* Microsoft Teams: send notices through Teams Workflows or an existing Incoming Webhook connector.
* Generic webhook: post JSON payload to any endpoint you control, with optional HMAC signatures. Failed deliveries are logged and highlighted on the Watchdog admin screen so you can reconfigure or resend manually.

=== Custom webhook payload ===

The JSON body contains `message`, `risks`, `links`, and `meta`. Existing fields are retained. The `meta.schema_version` integer is 1; `meta.event` is `test` for a channel test and `risk_report` for a report, including reports with zero risks. `meta.event_id` is a UUID generated for each payload and retained when that payload is retried or manually requeued. `meta.generated` is the creation time in Unix seconds; `meta.version` is the plugin version. Receivers may use the event ID to identify duplicate deliveries.

When a secret is configured, `X-Watchdog-Signature` contains `sha256=` followed by the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the exact request body. Verify it with a constant-time comparison before processing. The signature does not itself prevent replay; receivers should check the timestamp and event ID according to their own retry policy. A successful HTTP response confirms acceptance by the endpoint, not downstream processing.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the admin dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Open the top-level **Watchdog** menu in the WordPress sidebar to review the risk table and adjust notifications.
4. (Optional) Add your WPScan API key in the settings to fetch vulnerability intelligence.

== FAQ ==

= Does this plugin share my list of installed plugins? =

Risk processing and storage happen locally, but version comparison requires Watchdog to query WordPress.org for each installed plugin slug when its cache expires. If you add a WPScan API token, plugin slugs are also queried against WPScan. Watchdog does not send site content, user data, or telemetry to those lookup services. Email risk alerts to site administrators are enabled by default; you can disable them in settings. Webhook channels send detected risks only when you configure and enable them.

= How do I get a WPScan API key? =

Register for a free account at [wpscan.com](https://wpscan.com/) and copy the API token from your profile. Paste the token into the Watchdog settings page to enable vulnerability lookups.

= How do I configure Slack or Microsoft Teams notifications? =

Slack requires an Incoming Webhook URL that you can generate from your workspace's App Directory. For Microsoft Teams, create a workflow that starts when a webhook request is received, or use an existing Incoming Webhook connector. Paste the resulting HTTPS URL into Watchdog, enable the channel, then use its save-and-test button to verify delivery.

= Can I trigger scans manually? =

Yes. Use the "Run manual scan" button on the Watchdog admin page.

= How do I resend a failed notification payload? =

Open the Watchdog admin page and select the **Delivery** tab. If a notification fails, the payload is captured there with buttons to re-queue or download it.

= What happens to my data when I delete the plugin? =

Deleting the plugin from the Plugins screen removes its settings, saved risks, ignore list, scan history, notification queue, and scheduled events. Deactivating it only stops the schedule and keeps the data.

= Where can I find the test suite? =

Tests and the `phpunit.xml.dist` configuration are available in the public repository but are excluded from the published plugin package. Clone the repo from GitHub to run the test suite locally with PHPUnit.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Scheduled scans are not running ===

Watchdog relies on WP-Cron to trigger scheduled scans and notifications. If you have set `DISABLE_WP_CRON` to `true` or your site receives very little traffic (so WP-Cron rarely runs), configure a system cron job to call either `wp-cron.php` or the plugin's REST endpoint. The **Delivery** tab on the Watchdog admin page shows the endpoint and generated secret. Send the secret in an HTTP header so it does not appear in access logs; a typical example looks like this:

`curl -X POST -H "X-Watchdog-Cron-Key: YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET" https://example.com/wp-json/site-add-on-watchdog/v1/cron`

Testing-mode notifications also rely on this trigger, so be sure your cron job is running when validating delivery.

=== Discord works but email does not arrive ===

Email uses WordPress's `wp_mail()` function and your site's mail configuration. Discord and other webhooks use HTTP, so a working webhook does not confirm that the server can send email.

Use "Save and test email", then check the Delivery tab for a mail or SMTP error. Configure your host's mail service or an SMTP/mail plugin if needed. If WordPress accepts the test but no email arrives, check spam and your mail provider's delivery logs, sender verification, and SPF/DKIM settings. Acceptance for sending does not confirm inbox delivery.

== CLI Usage ==

Watchdog bundles a WP-CLI command so you can run scans outside of the WordPress admin. All examples below assume the command is executed from a shell where `wp` (WP-CLI) is available.

`wp watchdog scan [--notify=<bool>]`

* `--notify` (optional): Accepts `true` or `false` (defaults to `true`). When set to `false`, Watchdog will skip any configured email or webhook notifications and only record the scan locally.

Examples:

* Run a scan and send notifications (default): `wp watchdog scan`
* Run a scan silently (skip notifications): `wp watchdog scan --notify=false`

For automated checks, boot a WordPress/WP-CLI environment and run `wp watchdog scan --notify=false` to verify scanning without sending notifications. Run `wp watchdog scan` when you want the configured channels to receive new risk alerts.

== Development ==

The development repository is available on GitHub: https://github.com/happyloa/site-add-on-watchdog. Clone it locally to review the source or run the test suite.
