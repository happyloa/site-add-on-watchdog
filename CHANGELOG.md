# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-11-13

### Added

- Split the dashboard into Risks, History, Settings, and Delivery tabs. The overview now shows when the last scan ran and when the next one is due.
- Check plugins that have no WordPress.org directory entry against WPScan when an API key is configured. The "not in the directory" answer is cached for six hours.
- Delete the plugin's settings, saved risks, ignore list, scan history, notification queue, and scheduled events when the plugin is deleted from the Plugins screen.
- Add copy buttons for the server cron endpoint, secret, and command.

### Changed

- Take the dashboard accent color from the WordPress admin, so it matches the admin color scheme on WordPress 6 and 7.
- Declare `Tested up to` only in `readme.txt`, as the current Plugin Check requires.
- Verify the packaged plugin against WordPress 7.1.4.
- Hide a notification channel's fields while the channel is switched off. Saved values are kept.
- Show the site-wide WP-Cron notice only after the scheduled scan is overdue. Sites that disable WP-Cron and run it from a system cron no longer see a permanent error.
- Remove the "Retry notifications" button that appeared when WP-Cron was disabled. It did the same thing as "Send notifications now".

### Fixed

- Turn email alerts on by default, as the readme has always described. A new install saved the setting as off. Sites that never saved the Watchdog settings will start emailing risk alerts to their administrators after this update; sites that saved the settings keep their choice.
- Stop writing the cron status option and running two option deletes on every page load. A front-end request now makes one plugin query instead of five.
- Stop looking up administrator accounts before `plugins_loaded` on a new install, which logged a WordPress notice in debug mode.
- Leave the recipient field empty when the site owner empties it. It was refilled with the administrator addresses, at the cost of a user query on every request. Administrators are still included when an alert is sent.
- Remove a plugin from the risk table as soon as it is ignored. It used to stay listed until the next scan.
- Show every column of the risk table on narrow screens. Only the plugin name was visible.
- Send the report again when a REST cron scan is requested with `force`, even if nothing changed. The parameter was previously ignored for scans.
- Stop repeating an earlier notice after a later action or a page reload.
- Keep the "Download payload" button usable after the first download.
- Stop recording a diagnostic failure on every scan for plugins that have no WordPress.org directory entry.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- Add a schema version, event type, and event ID to custom webhook metadata. Retries retain the same event ID.
- Document the custom webhook payload and HMAC verification.

### Fixed

- Identify channel test messages without claiming a scan was performed.
- Avoid showing a successful manual scan notice when a scan fails.
- Describe WP-Cron availability without claiming scheduled tasks are running.
- Treat JSON encoding failures as delivery failures instead of sending an empty webhook body.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- Show WordPress mail and SMTP errors in Delivery health, with sensitive URL paths and common credential fields redacted.
- Catch exceptions from mail plugins so a failed email does not stop other notification channels or queue retries.
- Remove the temporary mail error listener after every attempt and record each failed email test once.
- Explain that a successful email test confirms acceptance for sending, while inbox delivery depends on the site's mail setup.

### Changed

- Verify the packaged plugin against WordPress 7.1.3 and document email troubleshooting.
- Update PHP CodeSniffer to address CVE-2026-67434 in the development tools.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- Confirm compatibility against WordPress 7.1.2 while retaining the WordPress.org `Tested up to: 7.1` convention for patch releases.
- Update the release ZIP, CI artifact, and WordPress smoke check to version 1.8.3.
- Align the public readme with the scanner, cache, WPScan, default email alerts, admin menu, and WP-CLI behavior.

### Fixed

- Keep a plugin's previous risk when its WordPress.org lookup or another plugin-specific scan step fails temporarily, while continuing to scan the remaining plugins.
- Retry failed WordPress.org lookups on the next scan instead of caching transient errors as missing plugins for six hours.
- Add regression coverage for risk preservation and lookup retry.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Update WordPress compatibility to 7.1.
- Verify the packaged plugin with an activation and notification-free scan on WordPress 7.1 in CI.

### Fixed

- Match exact released versions in changelog headings instead of similarly numbered versions or prereleases.
- Recognize heading levels 2 through 6 and inline heading markup without including unrelated entries.
- Skip versioned changelogs that have no matching release instead of reporting an unrelated security fix.
- Add eight regression cases for changelog version matching.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Filter WPScan vulnerability records against each installed plugin version and isolate caches by version.
- Require a genuine `POST` for the external Cron REST endpoint, reject method overrides, and accept the generated secret through the `X-Watchdog-Cron-Key` header or a Bearer token.
- Keep legacy query-key authentication available for existing `POST` jobs while no longer placing secrets in newly generated endpoint URLs.
- Clarify the WordPress.org plugin-slug lookups that are required for public version and changelog comparisons.

### Fixed

- Stop reporting WPScan vulnerabilities whose `fixed_in` version is already installed.
- Honor the WPScan rate-limit and temporary-server-error cooldown before sending additional API requests.
- Replace the non-working external Cron example with an authenticated request.
- Remove the hard-coded TLS verification override from the local Cron fallback.
- Add regression coverage for vulnerability filtering, API cooldowns, and Cron authentication.
- Refresh development-only PHPUnit and WordPress Coding Standards dependencies to patched releases.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Refresh plugin metadata and compatibility declarations for WordPress 7.0.
- Move service construction and lifecycle hooks into a dedicated bootstrap.
- Separate platform message formatting from notification transport and retry handling.
- Schedule the first scan in the background instead of making activation depend on remote services.
- Align Slack, Discord, and Microsoft Teams webhook payloads with their current platform limits and formats.
- Use WordPress safe HTTP requests for outgoing webhooks.
- Cache WordPress.org plugin information and isolate failures to the affected plugin during scans.
- Refresh the admin dashboard with overview cards, sticky section navigation, responsive settings, and guarded form submissions.
- Extract risk sorting into a focused, independently tested service.

### Added

- Add a new Watchdog icon and responsive WordPress.org banner set with reproducible asset tooling.
- Add a distribution ignore manifest so development files and directory artwork stay out of installable packages.
- Add a reproducible Windows release builder with WordPress-compatible ZIP paths and a Traditional Chinese TortoiseSVN release guide.
- Regenerate the translation template for every 1.8.0 admin and notification string.

### Fixed

- Contain bootstrap failures so an incomplete or corrupted installation cannot take down the rest of the site.
- Validate every enabled notification channel and disable invalid settings instead of failing silently.
- Add save-and-test actions for Email, Discord, Slack, Teams, and custom webhooks.
- Redact webhook secrets from delivery errors and logs.
- Preserve the previous saved report when a scan provider fails instead of replacing data or aborting the request.
- Register recurring schedules on `init` to avoid early translation loading notices on WordPress 6.7 and newer.
- Preserve the external Cron secret across requests and upgrades so configured scheduler URLs remain valid.
- Run continuous integration across PHP 8.1 through PHP 8.5.
- Replace direct debug logging with a structured `site_add_on_watchdog_diagnostic` action for safe extensibility.
- Use WordPress URL and text sanitization helpers consistently.
- Add the official WordPress Plugin Check to continuous integration.
